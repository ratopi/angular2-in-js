# Some simple Angular2 examples in plain JavaScript.

You need to install some node_modules before you use the app:

	cd src
	npm install

After that you should be ready to see the samples.

Start a http server providing the src-directory.
I use the "httpserver" from "npm":

	npm install -g httpserver
	cd src
	httpserver
