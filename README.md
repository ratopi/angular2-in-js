# Some simple Angular2 examples in plain JavaScript.

Writing Angular2 Apps in plain JavaScript is not as strange as it sounds.
If you keep your code tidy it's simple as writing it in TypeScript.
... and the best is: You don't have classes!!!

You need to install some node_modules before you use the app:

	cd src
	npm install

After that you should be ready to see the samples.

Start a http server providing the src-directory.
I use the "httpserver" from "npm":

	npm install -g httpserver
	cd src
	httpserver
